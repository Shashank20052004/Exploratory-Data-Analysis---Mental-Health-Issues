# Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ Mental Health Issues

This project aims to explore and analyze survey data related to mental health issues in the workplace. With increasing awareness about the importance of mental health, especially in professional environments, this analysis helps uncover patterns and insights that can assist employers and policymakers in creating more supportive workspaces.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between mental health and workplace factors such as company size, support availability, and employee demographics.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis

## Key Insights

* Analyzed how age, gender, and company size influence mental health conditions and the likelihood of seeking treatment.
* Visualized the frequency of mental health issues across different age groups and industries.
* Identified patterns in employer-provided mental health resources and their impact on employee openness to discuss mental health.
* Created heatmaps and bar charts to display correlations and categorical comparisons.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from a publicly available mental health survey conducted among employees in the tech industry. It includes information about demographics, mental health diagnosis, treatment history, and workplace support systems.

## Outcomes

This project reveals several critical insights, such as:

* Younger employees are more open to discussing mental health.
* Lack of employer support correlates with a higher reluctance to seek treatment.
* Gender and company size also influence mental health trends.

## Future Scope

Further work can involve predictive modeling, sentiment analysis on open-ended responses, or designing a dashboard to track mental health trends in real-time.
